EXAMPLE 1: Distributed Grep
------------------------------
You have a list of files and want to see how many times each word shows up in those files.
All of the map_reduce code is in lib/mapreduce_test.rb

To 
1. Run Skynet
 > ./script/skynet start

2. Watch the logs in another terminal
 > tail -f log/skynet.log
 
3. Run dgrep providing it with some words and a directory
 > ./script/dgrep -r love hate ./data

I've put all of shakespears poetry in the data directory.  You can download all of Shakespeare's work
to add to the data at http://www.it.usyd.edu.au/~matty/Shakespeare/shakespeare.tar.gz

Thats it!!

EXAMPLE 2: Distributed Grep with distributed reducing
------------------------------
Same example as above, but this time we want to aggregate our results across multiple partitioners. This would
be useful if you had a large reduce data set, or complex calculations in order to reduce.   All the code is already
in dgrep.pl.  Specifically, notice I've included a self.reduce_partition method (which just forwards to a pre-packaged
partitioner).  This partitioner not only breaks up the data returned from the mappers, but also makes sure each reducer 
gets all the same keys.

1. Run dgrep passing --reducers=2  This tells Skynet to try and use up to 2 reducers (instead of the default of 1)
> ./script/dgrep -r --reducers=2 data file ./data

This sample application was created by creating in the following way

1. Create new app
 > mkdir simple_example
 > mkdir data lib

2. Install Skynet
 > skynet_install

3. Add Data Files to /data
These are any text files named testfileN.txt and so on

4. Create dgrep.rb and drep script (found in lib/ and script/)

------------------------------------

EXAMPLE 1: Most Common Words
------------------------------
You have a list of files and want the 10 most common 5 or more letter words in all of those fules.

1. Run Skynet
 > ./script/skynet start

2. Watch the logs in another terminal
 > tail -f log/skynet.log
 
3. Run dgrep providing it with the '-mcw' (most common words) command, some words and a directory
 > ./script/dgrep -r -mcw ./data

To see what's going on check out lib/most_common_words.rb
------------------------------------

If you'd like get a peak at what Skynet is doing, edit ./config/skynet_config.rb and set

Skynet::CONFIG[:SKYNET_LOG_LEVEL] = Logger::INFO # or Logger::INFO

and tail ./log/skynet.log
