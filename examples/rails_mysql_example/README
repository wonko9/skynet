 ========================
 = Skynet Rails Example =
 ========================
 
Below you'll find a few example skynet uses within a rails application.
Rails itself is not included in the app so you will need Rails 2 installed locally.
You will also need to have mysql running locally.  If you have special permissions, please edit config/database.yml.

SETUP
-------------------------------------
> rake db:create
> rake db:migrate
> rake db:initialize_defaults


EXAMPLE 1: Complex Migrations
-------------------------------------
Lets say we were storing the user's favorites in a single comma separated field in the users table, but want
to normalize it into a user_favorites table.  This is something that would be difficult to do in straight SQL.
We have a method in our User model to migrate a single user.  All we have to do is run it on every user.

I added a rake task to run the skynet migration
> rake db:migrate_favorites

You can also choose to run the command (or other commands) yourself in the skynet console
                                                                                         
> ruby script/skynet console
console> User.distributed_find(:all).each(:migrate_favorites)
console> u = User.find(:first)
console> u.user_favorites.size

If you want to re-run the example, remember to run rake db:initialize_defaults again.



Example 2: Sending Email Asyncronously
-------------------------------------
> ruby script/skynet console
console> u = User.find(:first)
console> u.send_welcome_email 
# pauses 5 seconds while the user goes to another site and never comes back We don't want that!
# try again
console> u.send_later(:send_welcome_email)
# returns immediately, but sends the email after 5 seconds anyway

This sample application was created by creating in the following way

1. Create new rails app
 > rails -d mysql rails_mysql_example

2. Install Skynet with rails and mysql support
 > skynet_install --rails --mysql

3. Run skynet migrations
 > rake db:migrate
 
4. Create other migrations models
 > ./script/generate model user name:string password:string favorites:string email:string
 > ./script/generate model user_favorite user_id:integer favorite:string

------------------------------------------------------
If you'd like get a peak at what Skynet is doing, edit ./script/skynet and set

Skynet::CONFIG[:SKYNET_LOG_LEVEL] = Logger::INFO # or Logger::INFO

and tail ./log/skynet_development.log
