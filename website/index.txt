h2. What is Skynet

Skynet is an open source Ruby implementation of Google's MapReduce framework, created at Geni. With Skynet, one can easily convert a time-consuming serial task, such as a computationally expensive Rails migration, into a distributed program running on many computers.  If you'd like to learn more about MapReduce, see my intro at the bottom of this document.

Skynet is an adaptive, self-upgrading, fault-tolerant, and fully distributed system with no single point of failure. It uses a "peer recovery" system where workers watch out for each other. If a worker dies or fails for any reason, another worker will notice and pick up that task. Skynet also has no special 'master' servers, only workers which can act as a master for any task at any time. Even these master tasks can fail and will be picked up by other workers.

For more detailed documentation see the following:

Skynet::Job - The main interface to Skynet; includes an example of how to use Skynet

Skynet::Config - Configuration options

bin/skynet[link:files/bin/skynet.html] - Starting Skynet

bin/skynet_install[link:files/bin/skynet_install.html] - Installing Skynet into a local project

There are also some examples in the examples/ directory included with Skynet.

h2. Installation

Skynet can be installed via RubyGems:

  $ sudo gem install skynet

or grab the bleeding edge skynet in svn at
  $ svn checkout svn+ssh://developername@rubyforge.org/var/svn/skynet
  $ cd skynet; rake install_gem

h2. Initial Setup

Skynet works by putting "tasks" on a message queue which are picked up by skynet workers. The workers execute tasks and put their results back on the message queue. Skynet workers need to load your code at startup in order to be able to execute your tasks. This loading is handled by installing a skynet config file into your app running skynet_install[link:files/bin/skynet_install.html].

  $ skynet_install [--rails] [--mysql] APP_ROOT_DIR

This creates a file called skynet_config.rb in APP_ROOT_DIR/config to which you can add the relevant requires. For example, you might have a rails app and want some of that code to run asynchronously or in a distributed way. Just run 'skynet_install --rails' in your rails root, and it will automatically create config/skynet_config.rb and require environment.rb.

Skynet currently supports 2 message queue systems, TupleSpace and Mysql. By default, the TupleSpace queue is used as it is the easiest to set up, though it is less powerful and less scaleable for large installations. If you pass --mysql to skynet_install, it will assume you are using the mysql as your message queue.

h2. Starting Skynet

Once it is installed in your application, you can run skynet from your applications root directory with:

  $ skynet start [--workers=N]

This starts a skynet tuple space message queue and 4 workers. You can control how many workers to start per machine
by passing --workers=N.
